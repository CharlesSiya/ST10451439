1.THE Purpose 

This application will let the user insert data into it and save it and do some calculations if it must. This application will receive data from a user where they must insert the day, the minimum temperature, the maximum temperature, and the weather condition for a certain day. I explain more about my application below: 

2.Design Considerations 

 

This is the Splash screen where the user will have to enter their name and student number and click on the start button to process to the next page (Activity). If the user does not wish to be processed with the application, they can simply click on the exit button then the application will stop running. 

 

This is the main screen in my application. In the main screen the user will have to input the day, the minimum temperature, the maximum temperature, the weather condition. As soon as the user has added the data, he or she will have to click on the ADD button to save the data he or she has added to the application. There is a clear button too whereby if you click on it, it will delete all the data you have inserted in the application on the main screen. When you click on the view details button it will take you to my other screen (activity) where it will display the average Temperature using the data you have inserted in the application. 

 

This is the View detail screen (Activity). This screen will calculate the average Temperature of the temperatures you have added to the application and provide you with an answer in the above text views. 

3. GitHub Steps 

1. Create a New GitHub Repository: 

Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and sign in to your account. 

Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository". 

Give your repository a name (your student number and name – in one word), add a description (use IMAD5112 Assignment 1) and choose public. 

Click on the "Create repository" button. 

2. Initialise the Repository with a README File: 

After creating the repository, you will see an option to "Initialize this repository with a README". Check this option to create a README file. 

Click on the "Create repository" button to finalize the creation of the repository. 

3. Commit and Push Your Project Files to the GitHub Repository: 

In Android Studio, go to VCS (Version Control System) -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. 

Log in to your GitHub account if prompted and select the repository you created earlier. 

Click on the "Share" button to push your project files to the GitHub repository. 

4. Regularly Commit and Push Your Code as You Make Progress: 

After the initial push, continue making changes to your project in Android Studio. 

Whenever you make considerable progress or changes, commit your changes locally in Android Studio using VCS -> Commit Changes. 

Once committed, push your changes to the GitHub repository using VCS -> Git -> Push.
